What is HTML5


HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard markup language used for creating and structuring the content of websites and web applications. HTML provides a set of elements (tags) that define the structure and presentation of a web page's content, such as text, images, videos, links, and more.

Here are some key points about HTML:

1. **Markup Language:** HTML is a markup language, which means it uses a system of tags and attributes to define the structure and elements of a web page.

2. **Tags:** HTML tags are used to mark up the content on a web page. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets (< >) and come in pairs, where the opening tag denotes the beginning of an element, and the closing tag denotes its end. For example, `<p>` is an opening paragraph tag, and `</p>` is its corresponding closing tag.

3. **Elements:** An HTML element is a complete set of tags that define a specific part of a web page's content. Elements can be as simple as a heading (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.), a paragraph (`<p>`), or an image (`<img>`), or they can be more complex, like tables, forms, and multimedia embeds.

4. **Attributes:** HTML tags can have attributes that provide additional information about an element. Attributes are specified within the opening tag and give extra details, such as the source of an image, the destination of a link, or the size of an element.

5. **Structure:** HTML provides a hierarchical structure to organize content. Elements can be nested inside other elements, forming parent-child relationships.

6. **Web Browsers:** Web browsers interpret HTML code to display web pages. When you visit a website, the browser reads the HTML markup and renders the content accordingly.

7. **Version:** HTML has evolved over time, and different versions have been released. The latest version, as of my last update in September 2021, is HTML5, which introduced many new features, semantic elements, and improved support for multimedia.

HTML is just one component of web development. To make websites more interactive and dynamic, developers often use other technologies like CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling and JavaScript for client-side scripting and interactivity. Together, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript form the core technologies used to create modern websites and web applications.

Introduction to HTML5

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used for creating and structuring the content of web pages and web applications. It serves as the foundation for building websites and provides the structure and semantics necessary for displaying content on the internet. HTML documents consist of a series of elements (tags) that define different parts of the content and how they should be presented.

Here's a brief introduction to the key concepts of HTML:

1. **HTML Documents:** An HTML document is a text file with a `.html` extension. It is the basic building block of a web page. Every web page starts with an HTML document, which contains the content and instructions for web browsers on how to display that content.

2. **HTML Elements and Tags:** HTML elements are the building blocks of a web page. Elements are represented by HTML tags, which are enclosed in angle brackets. Tags define the purpose and structure of different content elements on the page. For example, the `<h1>` tag represents a top-level heading, `<p>` represents a paragraph, and `<img>` represents an image.

3. **Opening and Closing Tags:** Most HTML tags come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag. The opening tag denotes the start of an element, and the closing tag denotes the end. The content is placed between the opening and closing tags. For instance, a paragraph element is created using `<p>` as the opening tag and `</p>` as the closing tag: `<p>This is a paragraph.</p>`

4. **Attributes:** HTML tags can have attributes that provide additional information about an element. Attributes are specified within the opening tag and provide extra details about the element. For example, the `<img>` tag uses the "src" attribute to specify the image's source: `<img src="example.jpg" alt="An example image">`

5. **Document Structure:** HTML documents have a hierarchical structure, organized as a tree of elements. The root element is `<html>`, and it contains two main sections: `<head>` and `<body>`. The `<head>` section contains meta-information about the page, such as the title, character encoding, and links to external resources. The `<body>` section contains the visible content that users see in the web browser.

6. **Semantic Elements:** HTML5 introduced several semantic elements that provide meaning and context to different parts of a web page. Examples include `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, and more. These elements help improve accessibility, search engine optimization (SEO), and overall document structure.

7. **Nesting Elements:** HTML elements can be nested inside one another, forming parent-child relationships. Proper nesting is essential for creating well-structured and valid HTML documents.

When you combine HTML with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) for styling and JavaScript for interactivity, you can create modern and dynamic websites. HTML serves as the backbone of web development, providing the structure and content that make up the web pages we interact with every day.

HTML5 img tag


The HTML `<img>` tag is used to embed images into a web page. It allows you to display images on your website, providing visual content to enhance the user experience. The `<img>` tag is a self-closing tag, which means it does not have a closing tag and is written as a single element. Here's the basic syntax of the `<img>` tag:

```html
<img src="image_url" alt="alternative_text">
```

Let's break down the attributes used in the `<img>` tag:

1. **src (required):** The `src` attribute specifies the URL (Uniform Resource Locator) of the image you want to display. This URL can be a relative or absolute path to the image file. The image file can be in different formats like JPEG, PNG, GIF, etc.

2. **alt (required):** The `alt` attribute provides alternative text for the image. It is important for accessibility purposes and is displayed if the image cannot be loaded or read by assistive technologies (e.g., screen readers). The alternative text should describe the content or purpose of the image.

Example:

```html
<img src="example.jpg" alt="An example image">
```

In this example, the `<img>` tag displays an image called "example.jpg" with the alternative text "An example image."

Optional Attributes:

1. **width:** The `width` attribute sets the width of the image in pixels. It's used to specify the image's width on the web page.

2. **height:** The `height` attribute sets the height of the image in pixels. It's used to specify the image's height on the web page.

Example with optional attributes:

```html
<img src="example.jpg" alt="An example image" width="300" height="200">
```

In this example, the image "example.jpg" will be displayed with a width of 300 pixels and a height of 200 pixels.

It's good practice to always include the `alt` attribute, as it not only improves accessibility but also helps with search engine optimization (SEO) by providing meaningful information about the image content to search engines.

HTML5 anchor tag

The HTML `<a>` tag, also known as the anchor tag, is used to create hyperlinks that link to other web pages, files, or resources on the internet. When a user clicks on an anchor link, it navigates to the specified URL or target location. The basic syntax of the `<a>` tag is as follows:

```html
<a href="url">Link Text</a>
```

Let's break down the attributes used in the `<a>` tag:

1. **href (required):** The `href` attribute specifies the destination URL or the target location that the link points to. This can be an absolute URL (e.g., "https://www.example.com") or a relative URL (e.g., "page.html" or "../folder/page.html") that points to a resource within the same website.

2. **Link Text (required):** The link text is the visible text that the user clicks on. It serves as the clickable part of the hyperlink. For example, if you want to create a link to Google, you might use:

```html
<a href="https://www.google.com">Visit Google</a>
```

When users click on "Visit Google," their web browser will navigate to Google's website.

Example of an anchor link to a different page within the same website:

```html
<a href="about.html">About Us</a>
```

In this example, clicking on "About Us" will take users to the "about.html" page within the same website.

It's essential to use descriptive and meaningful link text to provide users with a clear idea of where the link will take them.

Optional Attributes:

1. **target:** The `target` attribute specifies where the linked content will be opened. By default, links open in the same browser window or tab. However, you can use the `target` attribute to specify a different behavior, such as opening the link in a new window or tab.

```html
<a href="https://www.example.com" target="_blank">Visit Example</a>
```

In this example, the link to "https://www.example.com" will open in a new browser tab because of the `target="_blank"` attribute.

2. **title:** The `title` attribute provides additional information about the link. When users hover over the link, the title text is displayed as a tooltip. It can be used to give users more context about the linked content.

```html
<a href="contact.html" title="Contact Us">Contact</a>
```

Here, when users hover over the "Contact" link, they will see a tooltip with the text "Contact Us."

Remember that accessibility is important, so ensure that your anchor links have meaningful text and descriptive `alt` attributes (for images used as links) to make the content more accessible to all users, including those using screen readers.

HTML5 title tag

The HTML `<title>` tag is used to define the title of an HTML document. The title appears in the browser's title bar or tab, and it provides a brief and meaningful description of the page's content. The `<title>` tag is placed within the `<head>` section of the HTML document, like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Content of the web page goes here -->
</body>
</html>
```

Key points about the `<title>` tag:

1. **Title Text:** The text enclosed between the opening `<title>` and closing `</title>` tags is the title text. It should be a concise and descriptive summary of the web page's content.

2. **Browser Display:** When a user visits a web page, the browser displays the title text in the title bar (usually at the top of the browser window) or in the browser tab. This helps users identify the page and is especially useful when multiple tabs are open.

3. **Search Engines:** The title is an essential element for search engine optimization (SEO). Search engines use the title to understand the content of the page and display it in search results. It's recommended to use relevant keywords in the title to improve the page's visibility in search engines.

4. **Dynamic Titles:** You can dynamically change the title of a page using JavaScript. This is particularly useful for single-page applications (SPAs) or websites that update their content dynamically without refreshing the entire page.

Example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Welcome to My Website</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
    <p>This is a sample web page.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

In this example, the title of the web page is set to "Welcome to My Website." When the page is loaded, this title will be displayed in the browser's title bar or tab.

Remember to keep the title relevant to the content of the page and make it clear and informative for users and search engines.

HTML5 comments

HTML comments are used to add notes or explanations within the HTML code that are not displayed on the web page when it is rendered in the browser. They are useful for providing information to other developers or for temporarily disabling parts of the code without deleting them entirely.

HTML comments start with `<!--` and end with `-->`. Anything placed between these comment delimiters will be treated as a comment and ignored by the web browser when rendering the page.

Here's the syntax for adding comments in HTML:

```html
<!-- This is a comment in HTML -->
```

HTML comments can span multiple lines, making them suitable for adding detailed explanations or disclaimers within the code:

```html
<!--
    This is a multi-line comment
    providing additional information
    about the HTML structure.
-->
```

Uses of HTML comments:

1. **Code Explanations:** Comments can be used to describe the purpose or functionality of certain parts of the HTML code. This can be especially helpful when the codebase is large or when collaborating with other developers.

```html
<!-- Navigation Menu -->
<ul>
    <li><a href="/">Home</a></li>
    <li><a href="/about">About</a></li>
    <!-- More menu items here -->
</ul>
```

2. **Temporary Disabling:** Comments are useful for temporarily disabling code blocks without deleting them. This allows developers to test how the page looks and behaves with or without specific elements.

```html
<!--
<div class="temporary-disabled">
    This section is currently under development.
</div>
-->
```

3. **Debugging:** Comments can be used for debugging purposes to troubleshoot issues or document potential problems in the code.

```html
<!-- TODO: Fix alignment issue in the footer -->
<footer>
    <!-- Footer content goes here -->
</footer>
```

Remember that comments are intended for developers and other individuals working on the codebase. They are not visible to users who visit the web page, so they do not affect the page's appearance or functionality. It's good practice to use comments to make your code more readable, maintainable, and collaborative.

HTML5 head comments

In HTML, comments can be added within the `<head>` section of the document to provide notes, explanations, or other metadata about the page. These comments are not displayed on the web page and are primarily intended for developers or anyone inspecting the page's source code. Comments within the `<head>` section can serve various purposes, such as indicating the document type, character encoding, author information, and more.

To create comments within the `<head>` section of an HTML document, you can use the `<!--` and `-->` delimiters, just like in any other part of the HTML code. Here's an example of how comments can be added within the `<head>` section:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <!-- This is a comment in the head section -->
    <title>My Web Page</title>
    <!-- Metadata for search engines -->
    <meta name="description" content="This is my web page">
    <meta name="author" content="John Doe">
</head>
<body>
    <!-- The content of the web page goes here -->
</body>
</html>
```

In this example, the comments provide additional information about the purpose of the code within the `<head>` section. Comments are helpful for documenting the code, making it easier for other developers to understand, and serving as reminders for future edits or improvements.

It's important to note that comments should be used judiciously and kept concise, as they are intended to provide clarity and context rather than clutter the code unnecessarily. Moreover, comments do not affect the rendering or functionality of the web page and are ignored by web browsers when displaying the page to users.

HTML5 heading

In HTML, headings are used to define the hierarchical structure of a web page's content. Headings range from `<h1>` to `<h6>`, where `<h1>` represents the highest level of heading (main heading) and `<h6>` represents the lowest level of heading (subheading). These tags are used to create headings and subheadings to organize the content and provide a visual hierarchy.

Here's the basic syntax for creating headings in HTML:

```html
<h1>Heading level 1</h1>
<h2>Heading level 2</h2>
<h3>Heading level 3</h3>
<h4>Heading level 4</h4>
<h5>Heading level 5</h5>
<h6>Heading level 6</h6>
```

Each heading tag represents a different level of importance and should be used to indicate the content's structure. The visual appearance of headings is usually controlled using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) to ensure consistency with the overall design of the website.

Example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Example Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    <p>This is the main heading of the page.</p>

    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>This is a subheading providing information about the website.</p>

    <h3>Our Team</h3>
    <p>This subheading introduces details about the team members.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

In this example, we have used different levels of headings to structure the content. The `<h1>` tag represents the main heading, `<h2>` is a subheading, and `<h3>` is a subheading within the subheading.

Headings are not only visually styled differently but also have semantic meaning. Search engines and screen readers use headings to understand the content's organization and importance, so it's crucial to use headings appropriately and maintain a logical hierarchy. Additionally, using headings properly improves the accessibility and usability of the web page for all users.

HTML5 </abbr>  tag


Apologies for the confusion in my previous response. I made an error in my explanation. There is no HTML `</abbr>` tag. The `<abbr>` tag is a valid HTML element used for abbreviations and acronyms. It is a self-closing tag, meaning it doesn't have a separate closing tag. The `<abbr>` tag is used to mark up text that represents an abbreviation or acronym and can include a "title" attribute to provide a full explanation of the abbreviation.

Here's the correct syntax for the `<abbr>` tag:

```html
<abbr title="Full Explanation">Abbreviation</abbr>
```

Let's break down the attributes used in the `<abbr>` tag:

1. **title (required):** The `title` attribute is used to provide the full explanation of the abbreviation or acronym. When a user hovers over the abbreviated text, the full explanation specified in the "title" attribute will be displayed as a tooltip.

Example:

```html
<p>HTML is short for <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>.</p>
```

In this example, when a user hovers over "HTML," a tooltip will appear displaying "HyperText Markup Language."

The `<abbr>` tag is not widely used for styling purposes but is important for providing additional context and accessibility for users. It helps them understand the meaning of abbreviations and acronyms used in the content


HTML5 paragraph


Sure, here's an example of an HTML paragraph:


```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>HTML Paragraph Example</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>This is a sample paragraph in HTML. It represents a block of text that will be displayed in the browser.</p>
</body>
</html>
```


In this example, the `<p>` element is used to define a paragraph. The text inside the `<p>` tags will be rendered as a paragraph in the web browser, and any content within the paragraph will appear as a continuous block of text.


HTML5 style


In HTML5, you can apply styles to elements using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). Here's an example of how you can add inline styles directly to an HTML element and also how you can link an external CSS file to style multiple elements:


1. Inline Style:
You can add styles directly to an HTML element using the `style` attribute. The `style` attribute takes CSS property-value pairs to style the element.


```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>HTML5 Style - Inline</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p style="color: blue; font-size: 16px;">This is a paragraph with inline styles applied.</p>
</body>
</html>
```


2. External CSS:
Alternatively, you can define styles in an external CSS file and link it to your HTML document using the `<link>` element in the `<head>` section.


HTML file (index.html):
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>HTML5 Style - External CSS</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <p class="highlight">This is a paragraph with styles applied from an external CSS file.</p>
</body>
</html>
```


CSS file (styles.css):
```css
/* styles.css */
.highlight {
    color: green;
    font-size: 18px;
    font-weight: bold;
}
```


In this example, we have an external CSS file named "styles.css" that defines a class called "highlight". This class applies the specified styles to any element that uses it, in this case, the paragraph (`<p>`) element.


Using external CSS allows you to style multiple elements across multiple HTML pages consistently. It's a more organized and maintainable approach, especially for larger projects.


HTML5 from


Certainly! Here's an example of an HTML form that includes various types of input fields and a submit button:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>HTML Form Example</title>
</head>
<body>
<h2>Contact Form</h2>
<form action="/submit_form" method="post">
<label for="name">Name:</label>
<input type="text" id="name" name="name" required>

<br>

<label for="email">Email:</label>
<input type="email" id="email" name="email" required>

<br>

<label for="message">Message:</label>
<textarea id="message" name="message" rows="4" cols="30" required></textarea>

<br>

<label for="gender">Gender:</label>
<input type="radio" id="male" name="gender" value="male" required>
<label for="male">Male</label>
<input type="radio" id="female" name="gender" value="female">
<label for="female">Female</label>
<input type="radio" id="other" name="gender" value="other">
<label for="other">Other</label>

<br>

<label for="subscribe">Subscribe to Newsletter:</label>
<input type="checkbox" id="subscribe" name="subscribe">

<br>

<label for="country">Country:</label>
<select id="country" name="country">
<option value="usa">USA</option>
<option value="canada">Canada</option>
<option value="uk">UK</option>
<option value="australia">Australia</option>
</select>

<br>

<input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
</body>
</html>
```

In this example, we have created a simple contact form with the following input fields:

1. Text input field for the Name.
2. Email input field for the Email address.
3. Textarea for entering the Message.
4. Radio buttons for selecting the Gender (only one option can be chosen).
5. Checkbox for subscribing to the newsletter (optional).
6. Dropdown select field for choosing the Country.
7. Submit button to submit the form data.

When the form is submitted, it will be sent to the server specified in the `action` attribute of the `<form>` element using the HTTP method specified in the `method` attribute (in this case, it's set to "post"). The server can then process the form data and perform necessary actions based on the user's inputs.


HTML5 hex color code


In HTML and CSS, colors can be represented using various formats, including hexadecimal color codes. Hexadecimal color codes are a way to specify colors using a combination of six alphanumeric characters, which represent the RGB (Red, Green, Blue) values of the color.

The format of a hexadecimal color code is "#RRGGBB", where RR represents the red value, GG represents the green value, and BB represents the blue value. Each of these values ranges from 00 (minimum intensity) to FF (maximum intensity), resulting in a total of 16^6 = 16,777,216 possible colors.

Here are a few examples of hexadecimal color codes:

1. Red: #FF0000
2. Green: #00FF00
3. Blue: #0000FF
4. Black: #000000
5. White: #FFFFFF
6. Yellow: #FFFF00
7. Cyan: #00FFFF
8. Magenta: #FF00FF
9. Gray: #808080
10. Orange: #FFA500

You can use these color codes in your HTML and CSS code to apply specific colors to elements. For example, to apply a red background to a div element, you can use the following CSS:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Hex Color Code Example</title>
<style>
.red-background {
background-color: #FF0000;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>
<div class="red-background">
This div has a red background using the hexadecimal color code #FF0000.
</div>
</body>
</html>
```

In this example, the div element will have a red background due to the hexadecimal color code #FF0000 being applied through the CSS class "red-background."


HTML5 iframe


An HTML `<iframe>` (inline frame) is used to embed another HTML document or web page within the current document. It allows you to display external content from another source, such as a different website or document, within your own HTML page.


The basic syntax for using an iframe is as follows:


```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>HTML Iframe Example</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h2>Embedded Page</h2>
    <iframe src="https://www.example.com" width="600" height="400" frameborder="0"></iframe>
</body>
</html>
```


In this example, we have an iframe that displays the content of "https://www.example.com". Here's a breakdown of the attributes used:


- `src`: Specifies the URL of the external page to be embedded in the iframe. Replace `"https://www.example.com"` with the desired URL.
- `width`: Specifies the width of the iframe in pixels or percentage.
- `height`: Specifies the height of the iframe in pixels or percentage.
- `frameborder`: Sets whether or not to display a border around the iframe. Setting it to `"0"` will remove the border.


Remember that when embedding content from external sources, make sure you have permission to do so, and ensure that the content is trustworthy to avoid potential security risks.


HTML5 list


In HTML, you can create lists using the `<ul>` (unordered list) and `<ol>` (ordered list) elements. The `<ul>` element is used for bulleted lists, and the `<ol>` element is used for numbered lists. Each item in the list is represented by the `<li>` (list item) element. Here's an example of how to create both types of lists:


1. Unordered List (Bulleted List):
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>HTML Unordered List Example</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h2>Bulleted List</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Item 1</li>
        <li>Item 2</li>
        <li>Item 3</li>
    </ul>
</body>
</html>
```


2. Ordered List (Numbered List):
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>HTML Ordered List Example</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h2>Numbered List</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>First item</li>
        <li>Second item</li>
        <li>Third item</li>
    </ol>
</body>
</html>
```


In both examples, we have a heading `<h2>` followed by either an unordered list `<ul>` or an ordered list `<ol>`. Each list item is represented by the `<li>` element.


You can also nest lists within one another to create hierarchical lists or use additional attributes and CSS styles to customize the appearance of the lists.


HTML5 script


In HTML, the `<script>` element is used to include JavaScript code directly within an HTML document. JavaScript is a programming language that allows you to add interactivity, manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model), handle events, and perform various other tasks on a web page. Here's how you can use the `<script>` element in HTML:

1. Inline JavaScript:
You can include JavaScript code directly within an HTML document using the `<script>` element with the `type` attribute set to `"text/javascript"` (although it's not necessary to specify the type attribute, as JavaScript is the default type).

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Inline JavaScript Example</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Hello, world!</h1>

<script type="text/javascript">
// Inline JavaScript code
alert("This is an inline JavaScript alert!");
</script>
</body>
</html>
```

2. External JavaScript File:
For larger JavaScript code or better code organization, you can create an external JavaScript file (with a .js extension) and include it in your HTML document using the `<script>` element with the `src` attribute pointing to the external file.

HTML file (index.html):
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>External JavaScript Example</title>
<script src="script.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Hello, world!</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

JavaScript file (script.js):
```js
// script.js
alert("This is an external JavaScript alert!");
```

In this example, the `script.js` file contains JavaScript code, and the `<script>` element in the HTML file includes the external script using the `src` attribute.

Remember that the `<script>` element should be placed either in the `<head>` section or at the end of the `<body>` section. Placing scripts at the end of the `<body>` section is generally recommended to ensure that the content is loaded before executing the scripts, which can improve page load performance.


HTML5 textarea


In HTML, the `<textarea>` element is used to create a multi-line text input field. It allows users to enter and edit multiple lines of text, making it suitable for longer text inputs like comments, messages, or descriptions. Here's how you can use the `<textarea>` element in HTML:


```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>HTML Textarea Example</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h2>Enter Your Feedback</h2>
    <form>
        <label for="feedback">Your Feedback:</label>
        <textarea id="feedback" name="feedback" rows="6" cols="40"></textarea>


        <br>


        <input type="submit" value="Submit">
    </form>
</body>
</html>
```


In this example, we have a form that includes a `<textarea>` element. Here's a breakdown of the attributes used:


- `id`: Specifies a unique ID for the textarea. It can be used for styling or JavaScript manipulation.
- `name`: Specifies the name of the textarea. When the form is submitted, the input's value will be sent to the server with this name as the identifier.
- `rows`: Specifies the number of visible text lines in the textarea.
- `cols`: Specifies the number of visible characters (columns) in each line of the textarea.


Users can enter text directly into the textarea, and the number of rows and columns specified will determine the initial size of the textarea visible on the web page. If the content exceeds the specified dimensions, scrollbars will appear automatically to allow users to view and edit the entire text.


When the form is submitted (by clicking the "Submit" button or pressing Enter while inside the textarea), the text entered will be sent to the server for processing or storage.
